# Data Umbrella Community Events Board

Front-end web application for Data Umbrella's community event board. The Data Event Board is being developed in collaboration between [Data Umbrella](https://www.dataumbrella.org) and [Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective](https://www.specollective.org) (SPEC). If you would like to get involved please email us at info@specollective.org. If you would like to donate to support this initiative you can make a donation to Data Umbrella on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/data-umbrella/contribute/data-science-event-board-37473/checkout).

This is built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

### `git clone git@github.com:data-umbrella/event-board-web.git`

You can simply clone the repository to the get code with the command above. To make code contributions there are two options.

1. If you have joined our community and already added as a contributor to the project, then you can can clone the code as described above.
2. If have an an idea for a feature or solution to a bug, and want to make open source contribution you can fork the repository and open a pull request. See Github's [Fork a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) tutorial for more information about forking repositories.

### `npm start`

Runs the React app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information about building apps built with create-react-app. Issues with failing to minify builds can be found [On the CRA trouble shooting page](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)

### `npm run lint`

Runs [ESlist](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface) for static code analysis. Particularly helpful when you are debugging react-scripts build issues due to linter errors.

### Backend API

This application depends on an API defined by [https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api) which has instructions for running the application locally via docker.

### Deployment

This application is deployed to Digital Ocean App Platform as a static application. For more information about deploying React applications on DO App Platform see
