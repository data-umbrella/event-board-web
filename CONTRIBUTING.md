### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information about building apps built with create-react-app. Issues with failing to minify builds can be found [On the CRA trouble shooting page](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)

### `npm run lint`

Runs [ESlist](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface) for static code analysis. Particularly helpful when you are debugging react-scripts build issues due to linter errors.

### Backend API

This application depends on an API defined by [https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api) which has instructions for running the application locally via docker.

### Deployment
