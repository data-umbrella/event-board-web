## About
This event board application is built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

There are two parts:  
1. front-end: [event-board-web](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-web) repository; [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-web/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
1. back-end: [event-board-api](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api) repository; [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Getting started

### Requirements & Installation
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): an open source version control system
- [Node​.js​](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Nodejs)​: is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm): is the JavaScript package manager
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) Node Version Manager (NVM), as the name implies, is a tool for managing Node versions on your device. Different projects on your device may be using different versions of Node. Using only one version (the one installed by npm) for these different projects may not give you accurate execution results.

### Installing Node
- [node.js package manager](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/package-manager/)
- [nvm install guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

### Fork & Clone the repo

Note: You will want to create a project folder and clone both the "event-board-web" and "event-board-api" repositories in to that folder.

Suggested folder name:  du-event-board
  ```console
  mkdir du-event-board
  cd du-event-board
  ```

```console
git clone git@github.com:data-umbrella/event-board-web.git
```

You can simply clone the repository to the get code with the command above. To make code contributions there are two options.

1. If you have joined our community and have already been added as a contributor to the project, then you can clone the code as described above.
2. If have an idea for a feature or solution to a bug, and want to make open source contribution you can fork the repository and open a pull request. See GitHub's [Fork a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) tutorial for more information about forking repositories.

## Setting up development environment

### Install correct Node.js version

This application depends on Node.js and `npm`. We recommend using a [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (`nvm`) for managing node versions. This application is current being developed on **Node 18.4.0**. 

To check the version of node:  
```console
node -v
```

To switch to the correct version of node, use:
```console
nvm use
```

If you don't have the correct version of node installed, use:
```console
nvm install 18.4.0
```

### Install Dependencies

#### Ensure you are in the project repository:

```console
cd event-board-web
```

Install the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file by running 

```console
npm install
```

### Starting development server

This web application depends on an API defined by [https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api) which has instructions for running the backend API locally via docker. To quickly get started with web application without the need for the backend running locally, you can run the development server with a fake backend powered by [mirage.js](https://miragejs.com) by running the start command with the dev modifier.

### Set up environment variable

To test the web application with the [event-board-api](https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-board-api) backend running locally, create a `.env` file with the following config.

```console
npm run start:dev
```

The React app will start up in development mode and be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```console
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

After starting up `event-board-api` server, simply run the start command.

```console
npm start
```

### Running tests

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```console
npm test
```

### Running static code analysis

Runs [ESlist](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface) for static code analysis. Particularly helpful when you are debugging react-scripts build issues due to linter errors.

```console
npm lint
```

### Pull Request & Code Review

For all contributions (documentation, bug fixes, new features), it is required to create a feature branch and then to submit a pull request. All pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers before being merged into the main branch. Maintainers may request changes to be made to pull requests before your code is approved. The repository is configured to automatically run tests and static code analysis via GitHub Actions when a pull request is opened or a branch is updated. All tests and linter checks must pass in order to merge the pull request.

## Returning to work

Once your development environment has been set up, and you have submitted a pull request, these next steps are helpful for returning to work:  

- On the `main` branch, sync your repo before creating a new feature branch
- If you are returning to work on a `feature-branch`, sync the repo so you are working with the latest code updates with `git pull`

## Tips for debugging

- [How to fix bugs, step by step](http://www.yacoset.com/Home/how-to-fix-bugs-step-by-step)
- Look at the debugger for root cause analysis
- For code debugging, in the browser, select "Inspect element" to examine the code

## Deployment

This application is deployed on Digital Ocean App Platform as a static application. For more information about deploying React applications on DO App Platform see the tutorial [How To Deploy a React Application to DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-react-application-to-digitalocean-app-platform).

## Best practices

1) **Project name**: consistently use the project name, which is "Data Events Board"
2) **Link text**: use descriptive text in link in lieu of "here". 

- *Do use* links with descriptive text:
    ```
    To support Data Umbrella and keep it running, please donate to the [Data Umbrella Collective](https://opencollective.com/data-umbrella)
    ```

- *Do not* include links in this format:
    ```
    [here][https://xxx.xxx.xxx/]
    ```

    Reference: [Descriptive text in hyperlinks](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21214#issuecomment-949678477) provides access to all users and people who have low/blind vision.

### Management dependencies and security vunerabilities

It's essential to keep the project's dependencies up to date to ensure the application is secure, performant, and compatible with the latest features of the language and libraries it uses. Below are general guidelines and practices for managing dependencies for JavaScript projects:

- Update dependencies regularly: Keep your dependencies up to date by regularly updating them to the latest version. You can use the npm outdated command to see which packages are out of date and need to be updated.
- Use a lockfile: Always commit changes to the package-lock.json to ensure that dependencies are installed with the same versions across different environments.
- Use [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-audit): Use `npm audit` to identify any known security vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. If any issues are found, update the affected packages to the latest version or find alternative packages that are not vulnerable. Using `npm audit fix` will automatically update packages that won't cause breaking changes
- Use `npm audit fix --force` with caution as it will upgrade packages that may break the application or cause bugs
- Resolve conflicts: If you encounter conflicts between different dependencies, resolve them by updating or removing the conflicting package.

## Contributing guidelines

1) To claim an issue, write "I am working on it" in a comment and then you can start working on it; there is no need to wait to be assigned on an issue.
2) A pull request should be submitted within two weeks or someone else can work on the issue.
